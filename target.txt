              <h3>Child Illiteracy</h3>
              <br>
              <p>There are still places in our country where the children donâ€™t even have the access to basic education.
                This,as well as other compounded factors, have led to a high rate of illiteracy in India.
                Initiatives by the Government to reduce the rate of illiteracy in India are
                far from being achieved, therefore it becomes all the more necessary to share some help.
                <br>
                Hence we,Medhavardhan Foundation have come up with some small initiative in place to reduce the
                illiteracy in
                India and we urge people to join us for this noble cause.

              <h3>Child Malnutrition & Poverty</h3>
              <br>
              <p>
                The deaths due to Starvation in India are more than the scarcity of food. It is also an outcome of the
                failure of administration organizations which are destined to aid the deprived and the underprivileged
                people. The government should implement the current as well as upcoming schemes with a motive to
                eliminate the starvation in India.
                <br>
                Hence we,Medhavardhan Foundation have come up with some small initiative in place to stop the fight of
                starvation in
                India and we urge people to join us for this noble cause.
